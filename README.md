# Mazes(Class Project)
Creates,visualizes, and solves mazes for the user. The whole program is presented to the user through a GUI. 
<ul>
  <li>Uses Kruskal's MST algorithm to randomly generate valid(solvable) mazes.</li>
  <li>Uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path between two spots.</li>

  <b>This is a class project, and the visual components were created by other students</b>. I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm, as well
as the min heap and disjoint sets data structures.
