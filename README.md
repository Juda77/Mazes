# Mazes(Class Project)
Creates and visualizes mazes for the user through a GUI. Uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path between two spots.
Uses Kruskal's MST algorithm to create valid mazes.

This is a class project, and the visual components were created by other students. I implemented Dijkstra's and Kruskal's algorithms, as well
as the min heap and disjoint sets data structures.
